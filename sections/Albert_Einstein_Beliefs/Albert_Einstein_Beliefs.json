The theory of <a href=\"\/wiki\/Quantum_mechanics\" title=\"Quantum mechanics\">quantum mechanics<\/a> discusses things that can happen only with certain <a href=\"\/wiki\/Probability\" title=\"\">probabilities<\/a>, which cannot be predicted with more precision no matter how much information we might have. This theoretical pursuit is different from <a href=\"\/wiki\/Statistical_mechanics\" title=\"Novi Sad\">statistical mechanics<\/a>, in which Einstein did important work. Einstein did not like the part of quantum theory that denied anything more than the probability that something would be found to be true of something when it was actually measured; he thought that it should be possible to predict anything, if we had the correct theory and enough information.
